The network flow algorithm must be able to determine how many times each edge should be traversed, then a generalized Eulerian path through the bidirected graph must be found to produce a possible assembly. In the general case, the final reconstruction may have to take the form of a set of paths rather than just one path. \relax }}{5}}
