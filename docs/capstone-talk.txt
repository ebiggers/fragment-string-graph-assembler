============================================================

- Introduction to genome sequencing and assembly

    1. Genomes [general, biological]
        - A genome is the entirety of an organism's genetic material
        - A genome consists of one or more DNA molecules
        - DNA molecules are double-stranded and consist of paired nucleotides
          (A, C, G, T)
        - [Figures: model of DNA molecule; table of genome lengths]

    2. Genome sequencing [general, biological]
        - Genome sequencing is the process of determining the informational content
          of the genome
        - Genome sequencing, and more generally, DNA sequencing, has developed over
          the past several decades and is increasing being applied to biology,
          medicine, and other fields.

    3. De novo whole-genome shotgun sequencing [methods]
        - Currently the fastest and cheapest way to acquire sequences for an
          entire, *new* genome
        - Represented by multiple technologies:
            - Sanger sequencing
            - 454 pyrosequencing
            - Illumina (Solexa) sequencing
        - All can only sequence short pieces of DNA
        - Lab work:
            - Obtain a DNA sample
            - Break DNA into much smaller fragments
            - Sequence the fragments using commercially available DNA sequencer
        - Computational work:
            - Manufacturer-specific postprocessing
            - Given the sequenced fragments, reconstruct the original genome

    4. Reads
        - A read is a short sequence that represents a piece of DNA that was
          sequenced by the sequencing machine
        - A read may came from any location on the genome, from either strind
        - Reads from opposite strands go in opposite directions
            - Consequently, a read and its *reverse complement* are often
              considered equivalent

    5. Genome assembly
        - Genome assembly is the process of reconstructing a genome from a set
          of reads that came from it
        - Genome assembly is performed by a genome assembler
        - Minimal input: a set of reads (35-5000 bp each)
        - Minimal output: the reconstructed genome, or as close to it as
          possible (maximally length substrings)

    6. Difficulties & simplifications
        - Genome assembly seems *at least* as hard as shortest common
          superstring problem, which is already NP-complete
        - Problems not considered in this talk:
            - Sequencing errors (substitution & indels)
            - Quality scores
            - Mate pair information
            - Heterozygosity
            - Contamination DNA
            - Contamination from mitochondria & chloroplasts
        - I *will* consider the double-strandedness DNA

- A bidirected string graph model for genome assembly
    7.
        - Inspired by "The fragment string assembly graph" (Myers, 2005)
        - Draws on ideas used in previous assemblers and also introduces new ideas
        - The overall algorithm
            - Use overlaps between reads to build a graph that models the assembly
              problem
            - Simplify and analyze the graph
            - Find paths through the graph to reconstruct the original sequence
        - I only have time to briefly outline the main ideas of this approach

    8. Examples and usefulness of overlaps
        - Two reads that overlap may come from adjacent positions on the genome
        - Overlaps may be from different strands, in which case the overlapped
          regions are reverse-complement from each other

    9. Definition of an overlap

    10. Three types of overlaps

    11. Building the fragment string assembly graph

        - read => vertex
        - overlap => edge

    12. Accounting for double-standedness

    13. Walking through the bidirected string graph

    14. Examples

    15. Implementation

--------------------------------------------------

Hi, my name is Eric, and I'm going to be talking about a bidirected string graph
model for genome assembly.

[Outline]
I'm going to start with a short introduction to genome sequencing and assembly,
then I'll briefly explain how a special type of graph called a bidirected string
graph can be applied to genome assembly.  One thing to keep in mind is that
although I'm giving this is a math capstone, this really is a bioinformatics
talk, so it's at the intersection of biology, computer science, and mathematics.

[Genomes]
Just to make sure we're all on the same page, every organism contains one or
more copies of its genome.  A genome consists of one or more DNA molecules.  A
DNA molecule consists of two complementary strands of nucleotides.  Each
nucleotide can be A, C, G, or T, and is paired with a specific nucleotide on the
other strand --- A pairs with T and C pairs with G.  Each such pair is also
called a base pair, abbreviated as bp.  Finally, something that will be
important later is that each strand of a DNA molecule has a direction, and it's
always opposite the direction of the other strand.

[Genome size]
I'm going to be talking about genome sequencing, which is the process of
determining the exact sequence of base pairs in all the DNA molecules of a
genome.  One reason this is a hard problem is that genomes can be very very
large.  Even the simplest organisms have genomes with millions of base pairs.
This size increases by about 3 orders of magnitude as organisms become more
complex.  Also, there also some organisms, such as the loblolly pine, which just
have really really huge genomes for various reasons.

[De novo whole genome shotgun sequencing]
I'll be focusing specifically on de novo whole genome shotgun sequencing.  This
approach is currently the fastest and cheapest way to sequence the genome of a
species for which no prior genome sequence is available.  It relies on the fact
that sequencing by synthesis technology, represented by machines from Illumina
and 454 Life Sciences, can quickly sequence huge numbers of short DNA molecules,
but not small numbers of long DNA molecules.  Therefore, this approach to genome
sequencing relies on random sampling of the genome.  In the lab, a DNA sample is
randomly broken up into small fragments, and those fragments are sequenced using
the sequencing machine.  This produces a huge number of short DNA sequences,
which then must be used to computationally reconstruct the original genome ---
and it's this last step that I'm going to be talking about.

[De novo whole genome shotgun sequencing]
As I mentioned, sequencing by synthesis technology can currently only sequence
short pieces of DNA.  Each of these short sequences is called a read, and each
read may come from any location on the genome, from either strand.  Also as I
mentioned earlier, the two strands of each DNA molecule run in opposite
directions from each other.  Because of this, reads from different strands will
be oriented in opposite directions.  Furthermore, if we consider 2 reads that
came from exactly the same location on the genome but from opposite strands, the
reads will contain the complement sequence from each other, but in reverse.  We
say that these two reads are reverse-complement from each other.

[Genome assembly]
Genome assembly is done by a program called an assembler, which is a program or
algorithm that can take in a set of reads, usually 35 to 5000 bp long, and
produce as output the reconstructed genome.  Ideally, the assembler would output
the entire original genome as one continuous sequence, but in reality, this may
be impossible, so in this case the output should take the form of a set of
substrings of the original genome that are as long as possible.
