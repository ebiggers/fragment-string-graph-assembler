abstract ={For the last 20 years, fragment assembly in DNA sequencing
 followed the “overlap–layout–consensus” paradigm that is used
 in all currently available assembly tools. Although this approach
 proved useful in assembling clones, it faces difficulties in genomic
 shotgun assembly. We abandon the classical
 “overlap–layout–consensus” approach in favor of a new
 euler algorithm that, for the first time, resolves the
 20-year-old “repeat problem” in fragment assembly. Our main
 result is the reduction of the fragment assembly to a variation of the
 classical Eulerian path problem that allows one to generate accurate
 solutions of large-scale sequencing problems. euler, in
 contrast to the celera assembler, does not mask such
 repeats but uses them instead as a powerful fragment assembly tool.},
